### Definition

A **Supply Chain Gateway** refers to the role an SME plays as an entry point into the networks of larger, more high-value organizations. Because SMEs often have trusted digital connections to their enterprise clients, they act as a "gateway" that attackers use to bypass the stronger defenses of the ultimate target.

### Explanation

Large corporations usually have world-class cybersecurity. However, they must "open their doors" to vendors, contractors, and suppliers to conduct business. Attackers exploit this trust. Instead of attacking the "front door" of the giant corporation, they hack the "side door" (the SME). Once the SME is compromised, the attacker uses the existing trusted tunnel (like an API, a shared portal, or an email account) to slide into the larger network undetected.

- **Scenario:** 🏗️ A small HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) company has a digital contract with a major national bank to monitor the bank's server room temperatures remotely. The HVAC company's security is weak. A hacker breaches the HVAC company and uses their **trusted remote access credentials** to jump onto the bank's internal network, bypassing the bank's external firewalls entirely.
    

### Example

- **The Target Hack (2013):** One of the most famous "Gateway" attacks. Hackers stole credentials from a small HVAC vendor to gain access to Target’s point-of-sale systems, leading to the theft of 40 million credit card records.
    
- **Vendor Email Compromise (VEC):** An attacker hacks a small supplier and sends a "fake" invoice to a large client. Because the email comes from a real, trusted partner, the large client is much more likely to process the malicious attachment or payment.
