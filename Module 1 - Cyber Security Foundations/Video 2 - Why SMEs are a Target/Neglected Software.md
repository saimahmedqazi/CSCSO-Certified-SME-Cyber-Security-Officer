### Definition

**Neglected Software** refers to applications, operating systems, or firmware that are no longer actively maintained, updated, or patched. This includes **Legacy Systems** (software so old the creator no longer supports it) and **Unpatched Software** (modern software where the user has ignored available security updates).

### Explanation

Software is never "perfect"; researchers and hackers are constantly finding new vulnerabilities (bugs) in the code. When a developer finds a bug, they release a **patch** to fix it. If an SME neglects these updates, they are essentially leaving their digital doors unlocked after a thief has already told the world how to pick the lock.

Neglect usually happens in SMEs due to:

- **Compatibility Fears:** Worrying that an update will break an old but "mission-critical" program.
    
- **Lack of Inventory:** Not actually knowing every piece of software running on their network (e.g., a forgotten plugin on a website).
    
- **"Update Fatigue":** Employees or owners getting annoyed by restart prompts and clicking "Ignore" for months.
    

**Scenario:** 📠 A small medical billing office uses an old version of Windows because their specific billing software doesn't work on newer versions. Microsoft stopped sending security patches for this version years ago. A hacker uses a "Known Exploit" (a blueprint for a hack that has been public for years) to enter the network. Because the software was **neglected**, there was no defense in place to stop a trick that has been "fixed" in the rest of the world for a long time.

### Example

- **Outdated CMS Plugins:** A small business WordPress site using an old "Contact Us" plugin that allows hackers to inject malicious code.
    
- **End-of-Life (EOL) Systems:** Continuing to use Windows 7 or older Server editions that no longer receive security definitions.
    
- **IoT Devices:** Office cameras or smart thermostats that haven't had their firmware updated since they were installed.
