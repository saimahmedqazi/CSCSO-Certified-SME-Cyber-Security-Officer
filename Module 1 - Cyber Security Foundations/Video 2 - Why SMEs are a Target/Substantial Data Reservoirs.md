### Definition

**Substantial Data Reservoirs** refers to the surprisingly large and concentrated "pools" of sensitive information that SMEs collect and store. While an SME might be small in headcount, the volume and value of the data they hold (customers, employees, and financial records) often match or exceed the profile of much larger organizations.

### Explanation

Cybercriminals target SMEs because they view them as **"Rich Targets with Poor Defenses."** Attackers aren't interested in the size of the office; they are interested in the size of the database. For a hacker, an SME is essentially a "reservoir" of monetizable assets that can be drained with relatively low effort.

These reservoirs are valuable because they contain:

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information):** Names, addresses, and Social Security numbers.
    
- **Financial Data:** Credit card details and bank account numbers.
    
- **Intellectual Property (IP):** Proprietary designs, recipes, or trade secrets.
    
- **Access Credentials:** Logins for the SME's partners or larger enterprise clients.
    

**Scenario:** 🏥 A local physical therapy clinic has only 10 employees. However, it has been in business for 15 years and its database contains the **full medical and insurance records of 25,000 patients**. To a hacker, this tiny clinic isn't a small business; it is a **Substantial Data Reservoir** that can be sold for a high price on the dark web or held for a massive ransom.

### Example

- **Customer Databases:** An e-commerce boutique storing 50,000 customer emails and purchase histories.
    
- **Payroll Records:** An accounting firm holding the tax details and bank info for hundreds of local business employees.
    
- **Donor Lists:** A non-profit SME with thousands of high-net-worth donor profiles and payment methods.
