### Definition

**Limited Governance** is the absence of formal structures, policies, and accountability measures used to direct and control an organization’s cybersecurity efforts. Without governance, security becomes "accidental" rather than "intentional," leaving the SME without a clear roadmap for risk management or regulatory compliance.

### Explanation

In large corporations, "Governance, Risk, and Compliance" (**GRC**) is a major department. In an SME, governance is often neglected because it feels like "red tape." However, without it, even expensive tools fail because there are no rules on how to use them.

Common signs of limited governance include:

- **No Incident Response Plan:** The business doesn't know who to call or what to do during a breach.
    
- **Lack of Access Policies:** No rules on who should have access to specific data (e.g., everyone can see the payroll folder).
    
- **No Vendor Oversight:** Signing contracts with third parties without checking their security standards.
    
- **Missing Compliance:** Failing to meet legal standards like **GDPR**, **PCI-DSS**, or **HIPAA**, which can lead to massive fines.
    

**Scenario:** 📁 A small accounting firm hires a summer intern. Because the firm has **Limited Governance**, they have no policy for "Provisioning" (setting up accounts). The intern is accidentally given "Admin" rights to the entire client database. When the intern’s laptop is stolen, the thief has full access to every client’s tax return because no governance policy was in place to restrict the intern's access to "read-only."

### Example

- **Shadow IT:** Employees using unapproved apps (like personal Dropbox accounts) because there is no policy forbidding it.
    
- **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Risks:** Staff using personal phones for work without any "Acceptable Use Policy" or security requirements.
    
- **Lack of Audits:** Never checking if the backups actually work or if terminated employees still have active logins.
