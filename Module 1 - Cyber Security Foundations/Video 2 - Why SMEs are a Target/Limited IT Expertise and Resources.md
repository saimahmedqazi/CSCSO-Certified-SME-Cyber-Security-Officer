### Definition

**Limited IT Expertise and Resources** refers to the lack of specialized personnel, dedicated cybersecurity budgets, and technical knowledge within an SME. This constraint forces the organization to rely on generalists rather than security experts, leading to gaps in defense, monitoring, and incident response.

### Explanation

This is often the #1 reason why SMEs are "soft targets." Attackers know that an SME owner is busy running a business and likely hasn't updated their firewall or trained their staff.

The "Resource Gap" usually manifests in three ways:

1. **Financial:** Small businesses often spend less than $1,500 a month on IT, which is not enough for enterprise-grade tools.
    
2. **Personnel:** There is often no **CISO** (Chief Information Security Officer). The person in charge of "security" may have no formal security training.
    
3. **Time:** Because the staff is small, they are often **reactive** (fixing things after they break) rather than **proactive** (preventing the hack before it happens).
    

- **Scenario:** 🛠️ A small manufacturing plant has an IT manager named Dave. Dave is great at keeping the network running, but he is overwhelmed. He knows he should implement **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** and perform **regular backups**, but he simply doesn't have the hours in the day or the budget to buy the software. A hacker exploits a known vulnerability that Dave was "meaning to patch next month," leading to a total system shutdown.
    

### Key 2026 Statistics

- **Budget Gap:** Nearly **47%** of businesses with fewer than 50 employees have **no dedicated cybersecurity budget** at all.
    
- **The "Generalist" Trap:** Most SMEs rely on general IT support, which is 77% more likely to miss sophisticated "malware-free" attacks that use stolen credentials.
    
- **Failure to Recover:** Because they lack incident response expertise, **60%** of SMEs that suffer a major attack go out of business within six months.
