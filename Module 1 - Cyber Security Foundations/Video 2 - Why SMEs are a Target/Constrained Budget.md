### Definition

**Constrained Budget** refers to the limited financial resources an SME allocates toward cybersecurity infrastructure, tools, and services. Unlike large enterprises with dedicated capital for defense, SMEs must often choose between business growth and security, frequently leading to underfunded and "brittle" security postures.

### Explanation

For a Security Officer, a constrained budget isn't just about having less money; it's about the **Trade-off Risk**. When funds are tight, SMEs tend to rely on:

1. **Legacy Systems:** Keeping old hardware/software because it’s "already paid for," even if it no longer receives security patches.
    
2. **Consumer-Grade Tools:** Using free or "home" versions of antivirus and firewalls that lack the advanced monitoring needed to stop professional criminals.
    
3. **Delayed Maintenance:** Skipping regular security audits or penetration tests to save costs in the short term.
    

**Scenario:** 🏢 A small retail chain is expanding to a third location. To afford the new rent, the owner decides to cancel their subscription to an **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)** service, reverting to a free antivirus. A month later, a sophisticated piece of malware—which the EDR would have caught—infects their point-of-sale system. The cost of the resulting data breach is ten times what they "saved" by cutting the budget.

### Example

- **Outdated Firewalls:** Using a 5-year-old router that doesn't support modern encryption standards.
    
- **Lack of Redundancy:** Having only one backup of company data stored on-site (to avoid cloud storage fees), which then gets encrypted by the same ransomware that hits the main server.
    
- **Shadow IT:** Employees using free, unapproved personal apps to do their work because the company hasn't provided professional, secure versions.
