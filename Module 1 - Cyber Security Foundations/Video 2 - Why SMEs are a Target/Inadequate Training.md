### Definition

**Inadequate Training** is a state where employees lack the necessary knowledge, skills, and awareness to recognize, prevent, and respond to cyber threats. Since **human error** is a factor in over 80% of data breaches, a workforce that hasn't been trained acts as an unintentional "open door" for attackers.

### Explanation

Attackers target SMEs specifically because they know these businesses rarely have a "Culture of Security." Employees in smaller firms often wear many hats and may prioritize speed or convenience over security protocols. Without regular training, they are highly susceptible to **Social Engineering**—attacks that hack the person rather than the machine.

Key areas where training is often lacking include:

- **Phishing Awareness:** Not knowing how to spot a fake email or a suspicious link.
    
- **Password Hygiene:** Reusing the same password across multiple accounts or using simple, easily guessable passwords.
    
- **Safe Browsing:** Understanding the risks of downloading attachments from unknown sources or using "free" software.
    
- **Incident Reporting:** Not knowing who to tell or what to do if they think they’ve accidentally clicked something malicious.
    

**Scenario:** 📧 A receptionist at a small architecture firm receives an email that looks like a "Late Notice" for a utility bill. Because the firm has **Inadequate Training**, the receptionist doesn't know to check the sender's actual email address. They click the "View Bill" button, which installs a keylogger. The receptionist doesn't report the incident because they don't realize anything happened, giving the attacker weeks to harvest credentials.

### Example

- **The "CEO Fraud" Trap:** An employee receives a fake email from their "boss" asking for an urgent wire transfer. Without training on verification steps, the employee sends the money immediately.
    
- **Social Engineering via Phone (Vishing):** An attacker calls an employee pretending to be "IT Support" and asks for their password to "fix a server issue." An untrained employee is likely to comply.
