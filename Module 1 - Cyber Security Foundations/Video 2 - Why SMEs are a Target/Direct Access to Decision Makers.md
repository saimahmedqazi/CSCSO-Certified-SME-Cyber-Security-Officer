### Definition

**Direct Access to Decision Makers** refers to the lack of "gatekeepers" or formal communication layers within an SME. This allows lower-level employees to communicate directly with top executives (CEOs, Owners), and vice versa. Attackers exploit this proximity to bypass standard verification protocols through **Social Engineering**.

### Explanation

In a massive corporation, a request for a $50,000 wire transfer from the CEO would go through multiple departments, assistants, and automated systems. In an SME, the CEO might just email the office manager directly. Attackers use this "flat" structure to their advantage by impersonating the person at the top.

The risk is amplified because:

- **The "Authority Bias":** Employees are eager to please the owner and may skip security checks to avoid "bothering" them or to show efficiency.
    
- **Lack of Verification:** Because everyone knows each other, there may be no formal process to "double-check" a sensitive request.
    
- **Visibility:** Business owners of SMEs are often very visible on LinkedIn or local news, making it easy for attackers to mimic their speaking style.
    

**Scenario:** 📧 A junior accountant at a small marketing agency receives an "urgent" email from the owner's personal address. The email says, "I'm in a meeting and forgot to pay this vendor. Please wire $5,000 immediately so our service isn't cut off." Because the accountant has **Direct Access** to the owner and wants to be helpful, they send the money without calling to verify. The email was a spoofed account.

### Example

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** An attacker hacks or spoofs an executive's account to authorize fraudulent transactions.
    
- **Whaling:** A specific form of phishing aimed at high-level executives, who are then used to "hook" the rest of the company.
    
- **"Urgency" Tactics:** Attackers use the personal nature of SME relationships to create a sense of panic that overrides logical thinking.
