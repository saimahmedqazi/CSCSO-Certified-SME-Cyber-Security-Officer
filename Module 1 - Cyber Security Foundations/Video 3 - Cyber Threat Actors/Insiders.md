**Motivation: Discontent**

- **Definition**: An **Insider Threat** comes from someone who has authorized access to the network, such as a current or former employee, contractor, or business partner.
    
- **Behavior**: Because they already have keys to the building, they don't need to "break in." They might steal intellectual property to sell to a competitor, sabotage systems out of revenge for being passed over for a promotion, or simply be a **Negligent Employee** who accidentally causes a leak.
    
- **SME Link**: In small teams, trust is high and permissions are often loose. This makes it easier for one disgruntled person to cause massive damage to the entire company's reputation or operations.
