**Motivation: Satisfaction**

- **Definition**: Often referred to as "Script Kiddies" or recreational hackers, these individuals are motivated by the challenge, the "rush" of breaking into a system, or gaining social status (clout) within hacker communities.
    
- **Behavior**: They typically use pre-made tools and scripts found online rather than writing their own code. Because their goal is personal satisfaction or showing off, they may be less organized but can still cause significant accidental damage.
    
- **SME Link**: They often target SMEs because they are easier to breach, providing a "practice ground" before they attempt more difficult targets.
