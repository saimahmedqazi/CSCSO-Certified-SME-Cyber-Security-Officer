### Definition

A **Bad Actor** (also known as a **Threat Actor**) is any individual, group, or entity that intentionally performs malicious activities with the intent to cause harm to a digital system, network, or organization.

### Explanation

Think of this as the "umbrella term." It doesn't tell us _why_ they are attacking or _how_ skilled they are; it simply identifies them as the source of the threat. In the **CSCSO** context, we use this term to move away from the generic word "hacker," because not all hackers are malicious (some are "White Hats" who help fix security).

A Bad Actor's goal is usually to compromise one of the three pillars of the **CIA Triad**:

- **Confidentiality:** Stealing secret data. 
    
- **Integrity:** Altering or corrupting data. 
    
- **Availability:** Shutting down systems so they can't be used.

### Comparison of Intent

While all "Bad Actors" are malicious, their methods vary:

|Term|Intent|
|---|---|
|**Bad Actor**|General malicious intent.|
|**Hacker**|Could be good, bad, or neutral (exploring systems).|
|**Adversary**|A bad actor specifically targeting _your_ organization.|
