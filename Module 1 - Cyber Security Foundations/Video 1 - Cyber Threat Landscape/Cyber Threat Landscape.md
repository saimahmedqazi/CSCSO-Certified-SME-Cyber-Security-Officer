### Definition

The **Cyber Threat Landscape** is a comprehensive "snapshot" of all potential and active cybersecurity risks, vulnerabilities, and threat actors affecting a specific entity or industry at a given time. "Today" (as of 2026) refers to a landscape defined by **high-speed automation**, **AI-driven attacks**, and **extreme commercialization** of cybercrime.

### Explanation

Understanding the landscape is not just about knowing the "bad guys." It involves analyzing three key pillars:

1. **The Actors:** Who is attacking? (e.g., State-sponsored groups, lone-wolf hobbyists using CaaS, or organized cartels).
    
2. **The Surface:** Where can they hit? (e.g., your remote employees' home Wi-Fi, your cloud-based SaaS tools, or your IoT office printers).
    
3. **The Trends:** How are they attacking? (e.g., moving away from simple viruses toward **Double Extortion** and **Supply Chain Attacks**).
    

- **Scenario:** 📈 An SME owner asks their Security Officer, "Why do we need to increase our budget this year?" The Officer explains the **Current Landscape**: "In 2026, the barrier to entry is lower because of **CaaS**, and attacks are faster because of **AI**. Our 'landscape' has expanded because we now use more cloud services than we did two years ago, creating new doors for attackers to knock on."
    

### Example (Current 2026 Trends)

- **Industrialized Crime:** Cybercrime now operates like a professional business sector with help desks, marketing, and R&D.
    
- **Geopolitical Influence:** Cyber warfare between nation-states often "spills over," hitting private SMEs as collateral damage (especially in the energy or finance sectors).
    
- **The Identity Shift:** Attackers are moving away from "hacking into" a system and toward "logging into" a system using stolen or AI-generated credentials.
