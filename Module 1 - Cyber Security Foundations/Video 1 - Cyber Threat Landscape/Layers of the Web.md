### 1. Surface Web (Clear Web)

- **Definition:** The portion of the World Wide Web that is readily available to the general public and searchable via standard search engines (Google, Bing, etc.).
    
- **Explanation:** These are sites "indexed" by search engine crawlers. It represents a tiny fraction—estimated at **under 5%**—of the total internet.
    
- **Example:** Wikipedia, news sites like BBC, public LinkedIn profiles, and e-commerce storefronts.
    

### 2. Deep Web 

- **Definition:** Any web content that is **not indexed** by search engines. It requires specific credentials (passwords), direct links, or access to a database to view.
    
- **Explanation:** This layer is not "evil"; it is built for **privacy and security**. Most of the internet (roughly 90%) lives here. It is accessible via standard browsers (Chrome, Safari) but gated behind security.
    
- **Scenario:** 🏦 When you log in to your **Online Banking** portal, you are in the Deep Web. Google cannot "crawl" your bank balance because it is protected by your login credentials.
    
- **Example:** Your Gmail inbox, corporate intranets, medical records, and academic journals behind paywalls.
    

### 3. Dark Web 

- **Definition:** A small, intentionally hidden subset of the Deep Web that can only be accessed using specialized software, such as the **Tor Browser** (The Onion Router).
    
- **Explanation:** It uses non-standard top-level domains (e.g., `.onion` instead of `.com`) and is built for **anonymity**. While it hosts legal activities (whistleblowing, avoiding censorship), it is a major hub for criminal trade.
    
- **Scenario:** 🕵️ A hacker steals a database of 10,000 SME customer credit cards. They do not post them on the Surface Web (where they'd be caught). Instead, they list them for sale on an **unindexed marketplace** on the Dark Web, where both the buyer and seller's IP addresses are masked.
    
- **Example:** The (now defunct) Silk Road, hidden forums for malware developers, and whistleblower sites like SecureDrop.
