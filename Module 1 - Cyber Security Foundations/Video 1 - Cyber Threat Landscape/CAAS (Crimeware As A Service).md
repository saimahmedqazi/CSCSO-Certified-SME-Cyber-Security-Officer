### Definition

[[Crimeware]]-as-a-Service (CaaS)** is a business model in the cybercriminal underground where developers sell or rent hacking tools, malware, and infrastructure to other criminals on a subscription or pay-per-use basis. It mirrors legitimate Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models.

### Explanation

CaaS allows individuals with little to no technical expertise to launch sophisticated cyberattacks. Instead of writing their own code, "customers" pay "service providers" for access to ready-made platforms. This creates a supply chain where distinct groups specialize in development, infrastructure hosting, or execution.

- **Scenario:** A disgruntled competitor wants to take down a rival's website but doesn't know how to code. They go to a CaaS provider on the dark web, pay $50 for a 24-hour "DDoS stresser" subscription, and enter the rival's IP address into a simple web dashboard to launch the attack.
    

### Example

- **Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS):** Renting a platform that hosts fake login pages and automatically collects victim credentials for the buyer.
    
- **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS):** Developers provide the ransomware code to "affiliates" who conduct the attacks; the ransom payment is then split between the developer and the affiliate.
