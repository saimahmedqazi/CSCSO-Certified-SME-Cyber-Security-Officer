### Definition

**Malware** is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or interfere with the user's computer security and privacy.

### Explanation

Malware is categorized based on **how it spreads** (its infection vector) and **what it does** once it arrives (its payload). For an SME, malware is often the primary tool used in data breaches and financial fraud. It typically enters a network through phishing emails, unpatched software vulnerabilities, or compromised websites.

- **Scenario:** 🖱️ An employee at a small law firm downloads what they think is a free PDF editor. Hidden inside the installer is a "keylogger." While the employee uses the PDF tool, the malware records every keystroke they make—including their login credentials for the firm's case management system—and sends that data back to the attacker's server.
    

### Example

- **Viruses:** Malware that attaches to a legitimate program and requires human action (like opening a file) to spread.
    
- **Worms:** Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks automatically without needing a host file or human intervention.
    
- **Spyware:** Software that secretly monitors user activity (web browsing, keystrokes) to harvest sensitive information.
    
- **Adware:** While often just annoying, aggressive adware can redirect browsers to malicious sites or track user behavior for profit.
