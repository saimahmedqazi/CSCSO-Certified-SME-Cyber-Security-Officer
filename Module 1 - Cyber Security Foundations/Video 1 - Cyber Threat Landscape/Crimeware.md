### Definition

**Crimeware** refers to a class of malware (software) specifically designed to automate cybercrime. unlike general malware which might be used for vandalism or disruption, crimeware is distinct because its primary motivation is **economic gain** through identity theft, financial fraud, or corporate espionage.

### Explanation

Crimeware lowers the barrier to entry for cybercriminals. It is often developed by skilled programmers but sold or rented to non-technical criminals in the underground economy (often referred to as the Crimeware-as-a-Service model).

- **Scenario:** An attacker wants to steal money but doesn't know how to code. They purchase a "crimeware kit" on the dark web. This kit provides them with a user-friendly dashboard to manage infected computers (botnets), harvest credentials, and automate the transfer of funds, treating cybercrime like a business operation.
    

### Example

- **Banking Trojans (e.g., Zeus):** Software designed to steal banking credentials from infected machines.
    
- **Ransomware Kits:** Pre-packaged software that encrypts a victim's data and demands payment, often including customer support features for the criminal to negotiate with the victim.
