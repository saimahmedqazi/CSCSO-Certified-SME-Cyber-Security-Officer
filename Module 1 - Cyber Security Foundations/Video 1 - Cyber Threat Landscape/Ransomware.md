### Definition

**Ransomware** is a type of malware that locks or encrypts a victim's data, files, or entire systems, making them inaccessible. The attacker then demands a **ransom payment** (typically in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin) in exchange for the decryption key or to prevent the data from being leaked.

### Explanation

Modern ransomware has evolved into a "double extortion" model. Not only do attackers lock your files, but they also steal a copy of them first. This gives them two ways to pressure you:

1. **Encryption:** "Pay us to get your files back so you can work."
    
2. **Exfiltration (Doxware):** "Pay us or we will leak your customers' private data and trade secrets online."
    

- **Scenario:** 🏢 A small accounting firm receives an email that looks like a legitimate "Unpaid Invoice" from a vendor. An employee clicks the attachment. Within minutes, every file on the firm's shared server ends in a strange extension like `.locked` or `.crypt`. A text file appears on every desktop stating: _"Your files are encrypted. You have 48 hours to pay 1.5 BTC or your data will be permanently deleted."_
    

### Example

- **WannaCry:** A global 2017 attack that exploited a Windows vulnerability (EternalBlue) to spread automatically across networks, hitting hospitals and businesses.
    
- **LockBit:** A common modern "Ransomware-as-a-Service" (RaaS) variant known for its extreme speed in encrypting files and its professional-looking ransom portals.
    
- **Crysis/Dharma:** A family of ransomware that frequently targets SMEs by brute-forcing weak **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** credentials.
