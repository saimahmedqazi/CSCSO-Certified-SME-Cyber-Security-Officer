### Definition

A **Malware Crypter** is a software tool used to encrypt, obfuscate, and manipulate the code of a malware file (the "payload") to make it **FUD** (Fully Undetectable) by antivirus and security scanners. A **Crypter Service** is a business model where developers sell access to these tools or provide "crypting-as-a-service" to other criminals.

### Explanation

Most antivirus (AV) software works by looking for "signatures" (unique digital fingerprints of known viruses). A crypter breaks this system by changing the file's fingerprint every time it is used.

A crypter usually consists of two parts:

1. **The Builder:** The interface the criminal uses to upload their "dirty" malware and "clean" it.
    
2. **The Stub:** A small piece of code that stays with the encrypted malware. Its only job is to wait until the file is opened, then decrypt the "dirty" malware directly into the computer's **RAM (memory)** so it never touches the hard drive where the AV could easily see it.
    

- **Scenario:** 📧 An attacker has a version of the "Zeus" banking trojan. Every AV in the world knows its signature. Before sending it in a phishing email, the attacker runs it through a **Crypter Service**. The service outputs a new file that looks like a harmless `PDF` or `Job_Description.exe`. When the victim opens it, the **Stub** decrypts the Zeus trojan in the background. Because the file's signature was scrambled by the crypter, the victim's AV remains silent.
    

### Example

- **Scantime Crypter:** Hides the malware while it is sitting on the disk (at rest), but might be caught once it starts running.
    
- **Runtime Crypter:** The more "premium" version; it keeps the malware hidden even while it's executing in the system's memory.
    
- **FUD (Fully Undetectable) Guarantee:** Many Dark Web services market their crypters by showing screenshots of "0/50 detections" on private scanning sites (which don't report back to AV companies).
