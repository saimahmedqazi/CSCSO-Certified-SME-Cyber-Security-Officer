### Definition

**Bulletproof Hosting** is an internet hosting service that intentionally ignores or bypasses "Acceptable Use Policies" (AUP) by refusing to act on takedown notices, abuse complaints, or law enforcement subpoenas. These providers specifically cater to customers who host illegal or malicious content.

### Explanation

The "bulletproof" part of the name refers to the provider's resistance to legal pressure. They achieve this primarily through **Strategic Jurisdiction** (operating in "Lax Jurisdictions").

- **Lax Jurisdictions:** These are countries with weak cybercrime laws, limited international cooperation (no extradition treaties), or corrupt officials. By placing servers in these regions, the provider can claim they aren't "breaking the law" of their host country, even if the content is illegal globally.
    
- **The Model:** They often charge much higher fees than legitimate hosts (like AWS or GoDaddy) because they are taking on legal risk and provide a "no questions asked" service.
    

**Scenario:** 📁 A hacker group launches a global phishing campaign targeting small businesses. If they used a standard host like Google Cloud, their site would be taken down in hours after the first report. Instead, they pay a Bulletproof Host located in a country with **no mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT)** with the West. When the FBI sends a takedown request, the host simply deletes the email and keeps the phishing site online.

### Example

- **CyberBunker:** A famous (now defunct) provider that operated out of a literal former NATO bunker and hosted everything from botnets to illegal marketplaces.
    
- **Offshore Hosting:** Services marketed in regions like the Seychelles or specific Eastern European/Central Asian territories where local authorities are unlikely to intervene.
    
- **Infrastructure Laundering:** BPH providers who rent "clean" IP addresses from legitimate providers to hide their malicious traffic, making it harder for Security Officers to block them based on IP reputation.
